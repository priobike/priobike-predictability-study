# Cycle discrepancy <-> Wait time diversity case study data

- Random subset of all are in `random/`/`random_right_25`folder (picked with `select_random_case_studies.ipynb` script in this directory)
    - right_25 means that the threshold for top_right and bottom_right is 25 (cycle discrepancy)
- In folder `hand_picked/` are case studies that are hand picked from the "bottom_right" and "top_right" category with more cycles than most in the `random/` subset (for those categories cells with many cycles are rare, so we picked some of them to have more examples of those cells)
